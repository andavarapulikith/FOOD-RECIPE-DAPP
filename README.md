# Food DAPP end to end

I've created a decentralized food recipe marketplace DApp using Solidity for smart contracts and React for the frontend, with development and testing facilitated by Hardhat. Users can connect to the DApp via the Goerli network using MetaMask. Within the marketplace, users can buy and  sell unique food recipe NFTs, each representing a specific dish with detailed information, such as ingredients, cooking instructions. The integration with the Goerli network and MetaMask wallet ensures a secure and user-friendly experience, allowing food enthusiasts and collectors to explore favorite recipes in a transparent and decentralized manner. 

To set up the repository and run the marketplace locally, run the below
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat run --network goerli
npm start
```
